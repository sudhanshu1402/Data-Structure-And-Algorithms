Time complexity [What is the time complexity of the following code :]

1.Basic primer

Question:01

  A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
 
  B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
 
  C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)
 
  D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)


sol:- 
The time complexity of the first for loop is O(n). 

The time complexity of the second for loop is O(n/2), equivalent to O(n) in asymptotic analysis. 

The time complexity of the third for loop is O(logn). 

The fourth for loop doesn't terminate. 


Question:02

        int a = 0, i = N;
        while (i > 0) {
            a += i;
            i /= 2;
        }



Approach :-
Notice that in every iteration, i goes to i / 2

So, after x iterations, i will be N / 2^x

We have to find first x such that N / 2^x < 1 OR 2^x > N
